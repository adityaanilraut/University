Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that reviews research that involves humans to ensure it meets ethical standards and protects participants. IRBs protect the rights, safety, and welfare of research participants. They also ensure that research complies with regulations, follows institutional policies, and meets ethical standards. IRBs review research before it begins, and have the authority to approve, disapprove, exempt, monitor, or modify research. They also ensure that informed consent documents are adequate and understandable.
The three ethical concepts—respecting autonomy, achieving equity, and protecting privacy—are core to ethical research, particularly in Big Data. Autonomy emphasizes the individual's right to make informed decisions about their participation. However, the same challenge faced by autonomy is that it is impractical to get consent from every entity present in the data. The second concept is achieving equity, which is in theory a good goal to aim for but is hardly ever achieved. However, researchers should always strive for equity in data. The third concept is privacy. Privacy is fundamental to trust in research and is a human right. Even Here there are some constrain. Complete privacy protection in Big Data might stifle innovation or make certain research prohibitively expensive.
When it comes to compensation no amount can ethically override these principles. While compensation might make participation appealing, it should not(in an ideal world) ethically override consent or privacy protections. According to me Allowing financial incentives may lead to exploitation or harm.
