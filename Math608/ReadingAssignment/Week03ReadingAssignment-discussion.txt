In the first paper, we discussed about using DSV (Delimiter-Separated Values) instead of CSV (Comma-Separated Values). Although DSV provides good separation and fewer errors in data, it is not feasible to use DSV as most of the datasets present are already in CSV format. Adding to the same CSVs are widely adopted and supported by most of the software platforms and tools, whereas DSV lacks such a universal standard.
In the second paper, our main concern discussed was the lack of transparency in how data from the AI chatbot’s interactions with real people was handled. Also, the fact that the training data was not shared by which the action was taken by the AI model. This lack of openness raises concerns about accountability and the possibility of biased decision-making within the system.
We talked about how the AI chatbot's deployment had lost its original purpose. The AI was initially intended to prevent crimes and safeguard society, not just to make more arrests. Empathy toward a human being was missing throughout its interactions. The motivation behind the chatbot’s creation had seemingly shifted from its original intent.
In conclusion, our group discussed several important points regarding AI chatbots in law enforcement. In enforcement, we agree that AI plays an important role in finding criminals but in the end, it should all be done under human supervision.
