    "This week's worksheet will be a rough guide to the plotting software [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) in Python.  I say this is a rough guide, because Matplotlib is a world unto itself.  Not only is the documentation comprehensive, but there's volumes written about the possibilities in Matplotlib.  Consider this ~250 page book written on the package: [Scientific Visualization: python and matplotlib](https://github.com/rougier/scientific-visualization-book). "

As always, I encourage you to read source documentation instead of Google-ing or GPT-ing for answers.  Reading package source documentaton is a valuable skill to be learned, and your best bet for finding up to date information about any given package."
